# 🎨 *Artist.AI*

### Artist.AI is an immersive, interactive web application that bridges the gap between art history and modern artificial intelligence. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini AI, this project allows users to converse with simulated personas of history's greatest artistic masters.
### The application wraps complex AI technology in a visually stunning, gallery-inspired interface, creating an atmosphere that feels less like a computer program and more like a séance with the past.

## *Why did I choose this theme?*
### The UI is anchored by Van Gogh's Starry Night Over the Rhône. I chose this aesthetic theme to create an immersive, dark-mode environment that reduces eye strain while evoking a sense of history and intimacy. The high-contrast palette of Midnight Blue and Electric Lime ensures accessibility, while the Impressionist visual style serves as a metaphor for the AI itself: a digital impression of a human soul.

## *What is this Chatbot?*
Artist.AI is a Persona-Based Conversational Agent. Unlike standard chatbots (like ChatGPT or Siri) which act as helpful assistants, Artist.AI is designed to roleplay. 
When a user selects an artist, the AI adopts the: 
1. The Vocabulary: Speaking in the dialect and tone of the late 19th century.
2. The Knowledge Base: Possessing deep knowledge of that specific artist's paintings, timeline, friends, and enemies.
3. The Psychology: This is a key feature shown in the UI. The bot doesn't just recite facts, it simulates the artist's emotional state, struggles with mental health, and artistic philosophy.

## *Key Benefits for the User*
Why would someone use Artist.AI? and for what is this chatbot?
1. This chatbot is for the artist especially the people who are creative, passionate & love making art.
### *Immersive* 
2. Instead of reading a dry Wikipedia article about The Starry Night, a student can ask Vincent, "Why did you paint the sky swirling like that?" The AI provides an answer rooted in the artist's actual letters and historical context, making learning personal and memorable.
### *Creative Inspiration*
3. Artists and designers suffering from creative block can "consult" with Da Vinci or Picasso. Users can ask for advice on composition, color theory, or how to break through artistic stagnation, receiving advice from the perspective of a master.
### *Entertainment & Roleplay*
4. For history buffs, it serves as a high-fidelity "What If" scenario. It allows for impossible conversations, such as asking Da Vinci what he thinks of modern digital art.
