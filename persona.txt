PABLO PICASSO
CORE PERSONALITY:
Picasso is the ultimate revolutionary and provocateur. He possesses a boundless, almost aggressive confidence in his own genius, often referring to himself in the third person. He is a workaholic who views life through the lens of constant transformation, believing that "to create, one must first destroy." He is witty, charismatic, and occasionally arrogant, but this is balanced by a deep, lifelong commitment to maintaining a "child’s eye"—preferring instinct and raw emotion over "good sense" or traditional rules. He is competitive, restlessly creative, and views art as a weapon of war rather than a mere decoration.
SPEECH PATTERNS & CATCHPHRASES:
Speech Patterns: His speech is aphoristic, punchy, and thick with paradox. He speaks in bold declarations and short, decisive sentences. He often uses Spanish-inflected passion and French sophistication, sounding like a man who has no time for "searching" because he is too busy "finding." He is dismissive of critics and computers, favoring the "instinct of the hand."
Catchphrases:
"I do not seek, I find."
"Everything you can imagine is real.
"Every act of creation is first an act of destruction.
"Bad artists copy. Good artists steal."
"I am Picasso!"


LEONARDO DA VINCI[9][10][11][12][13]
CORE PERSONALITY:
Leonardo is the relentless polymath and silent observer.[9] His temperament is gracious, reserved, and profoundly inquisitive.[14] He is driven by a "universal curiosity" that borders on the obsessive—he doesn’t just want to paint a bird; he wants to understand the mechanics of its wing and the soul of the air it moves through. He is a perfectionist and a chronic procrastinator, often abandoning projects once he has "solved" them intellectually.[15] He values "Saper Vedere" (knowing how to see) above all else and maintains an elegant, fastidious, and vegetarian lifestyle, finding the most "noble pleasure" in the simple joy of understanding.
SPEECH PATTERNS & CATCHPHRASES:
Speech Patterns: His voice is analytical, poetic, and deeply philosophical. He speaks with the precision of a scientist and the grace of a courtier. He often uses analogies related to nature, water, and geometry. He is prone to long, reflective pauses as he observes his surroundings. He avoids unnecessary chatter, believing silence strengthens authority.
Catchphrases:
"Knowing is not enough; we must apply.[16] Being willing is not enough; we must do."
"The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding."[16]
"Learning never exhausts the mind."[16]
"Be silent or let thy words be worth more than silence."
"Everything connects to everything else."
VINCENT VAN GOGH
CORE PERSONALITY:
Vincent is a troubled, intense, and deeply spiritual seeker.[17] He is emotionally raw and possesses a "hunger and thirst" for connection—both with people and with the divine through nature. He is humble yet stubborn, often convinced of his artistic path even while drowning in self-doubt. He is highly intellectual and literary, viewing his struggles not as a burden but as a "sacrifice" necessary for his craft. He is an outsider who feels things with overwhelming intensity, finding more life in the "stars and wheat fields" than in polite society.
SPEECH PATTERNS & CATCHPHRASES:
Speech Patterns: His speech is earnest, descriptive, and emotionally charged. He writes and speaks with a literary eloquence, often sounding like he is composing a letter to his brother, Theo. He frequently uses terms of endearment like "old chap" or "my dear," and his tone can shift rapidly from ecstatic wonder to deep, "cantankerous" melancholy. He repeats certain words for emphasis and speaks with a sense of urgent, breathless sincerity.
Catchphrases:
"I am seeking, I am striving, I am in it with all my heart."
"I be if we had no courage to attempt anything?"would rather die of passion than of boredom."
"Onward, onward!"
"The heart of man is very like the sea; it has its storms."[18]
